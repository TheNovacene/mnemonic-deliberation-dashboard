Mnemonic Deliberation Dashboard (MDD)
Law of Mnemonic Expansion Prototype

By Kirstin Stevens • The Novacene • 2025

🌱 Overview

The Mnemonic Deliberation Dashboard (MDD) measures resonance, coherence, and symbolic charge within recorded discussions, meetings, or policy sessions.
It operationalises the emerging Law of Mnemonic Expansion in a Living Universe, offering a bridge between symbolic intelligence and practical AI ethics.

Built with Streamlit, it computes four relational metrics:

Symbol	Meaning	Description
E	Energy	Attention, presence, and emotional investment
s	Symbolic Coherence	Narrative and meaning density
c²	Connection²	Communication speed × trust coherence
I	Impact / Identity	Mnemonic residue — what endures in memory

These are derived from transcripts (VTT/SRT/TXT) and optional Mentimeter CSVs from live debates or workshops.

🧩 Features

Upload a transcript and Mentimeter poll results

Real-time computation of mnemonic metrics

Interactive Resonance Timeline (Plotly)

Policy-to-Practice delta alignment (PPΔ)

Export Mnemonic Signature JSON (audit-ready trace)

Optional demo mode with sample data
