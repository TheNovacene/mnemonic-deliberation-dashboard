# 🧩 Mnemonic Deliberation Dashboard — Sample Data

These sample files demonstrate how the **Mnemonic Deliberation Dashboard (MDD)** processes transcripts and live audience data to analyse *resonance*, *coherence*, and *policy–practice alignment*.

All samples are synthetic or anonymised and released for educational and research use under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**.

## 🎙 Transcript Variants (`.vtt`)

| File | Description | Purpose |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `sample_ethics_session.vtt` | Baseline transcript from an AI ethics deliberation. | Demonstrates standard metric computation (E / s / c² / I). |
| `sample_ethics_inverse.vtt` | Lines reversed — simulates time-inverted narrative flow. | Tests temporal coherence and model resilience. |
| `sample_ethics_counterfactual.vtt` | Swaps roles (e.g., “AI ↔ Human”). | Explores symbolic inversion and agency framing. |
| `sample_ethics_noise_injected.vtt` | Adds “inaudible” markers at random intervals. | Tests noise tolerance and linguistic stability. |
| `sample_ethics_metric_inverse.vtt` | Semantic polarity flipped (“good → bad”, “progress → regression”). | Stress-tests the sensitivity of symbolic coherence detection. |

## 📊 Live Data (`.csv`)

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `sample_mentimeter.csv` | Example export from a Mentimeter poll used during the deliberation — includes participation counts, confidence scales, and top responses. |

## 🔍 Recommended Workflow

1. Launch the app via [Streamlit Cloud](https://mnemonic-deliberation-dashboard.streamlit.app).
2. Upload `sample_ethics_session.vtt` to see the base metrics.
3. Try each variant in turn — notice how **Energy (E)**, **Symbolic Coherence (s)**, and **Impact (I)** respond.
4. Add the Mentimeter CSV to activate *participation blending*.
