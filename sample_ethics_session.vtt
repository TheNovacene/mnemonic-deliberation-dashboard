00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Facilitator: Welcome everyone. Today we need concrete next steps. Our aim is a plain-language model notice so families actually understand what the AI does.

2
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Teacher: I like the focus on a clear model notice. Students ask me all the time what the chatbot records.

3
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Policy-Maker: Transparency is a duty. The EU AI Act requires accessible information to affected persons. Let's use plain-language examples.

4
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Skeptic: I worry about cognitive offloading and inequity. If we add another tool, who monitors harm?

5
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Innovator: There’s potential for personalised support. But we need to make it explainable to users, not a black box.

6
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Student: Please no jargon. Just tell us what data you keep and how to turn it off.

7
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Skeptic: That's not what I said. I'm not anti‑AI—I want guard rails.

8
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Innovator: Guardian rails, not a cage. Can we prototype a notice inside Canvas?

9
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Teacher: To be clear, I need something I can read aloud in two minutes.

10
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Facilitator: Good. Question: who is the human‑in‑the‑loop when responses go wrong?

11
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Policy-Maker: Escalation path is unclear. Manual review by a person must be defined.

12
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Student: Who do we email if the bot is creepy?

13
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Teacher: Could the DSL be first line? Then senior leader on call?

14
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Policy-Maker: Possibly, but roles need documenting. We can draft a RACI after this.

15
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Skeptic: Until oversight is real, we should limit use to low‑risk prompts.

16
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Innovator: Agreed. Start with retrieval practice only, then expand.

17
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Facilitator: So: pilot in one subject, clear escalation route, publish a notice. Anything else?

18
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Skeptic: Where is the DPIA? If there’s no Data Protection Impact Assessment this is risky.

19
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Policy-Maker: We haven't completed a DPIA yet. Model card is draft.

20
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Teacher: I don't know what a DPIA is, sorry.

21
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Student: Same.

22
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Innovator: We can ship the notice without waiting, right?

23
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Facilitator: Bridge proposal: 'scaffold not cage'—we start small, explain clearly, and measure impact with students.

24
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Teacher: That works. I'll test the script in mentor circle.

25
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Student: Yes, and add a toggle to opt‑out.

26
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Skeptic: If opt‑out is easy and oversight is real, I'm on board.

27
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Policy-Maker: We still need documentation.

28
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Innovator: Prototype by Friday; RACI next week.

29
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Teacher: You’ve misunderstood my concern—reading level must be age‑appropriate.

30
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Facilitator: Noted. Two versions: KS3 and KS4.

31
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Student: Also add an emoji summary?

32
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Innovator: Done.

33
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Skeptic: And we log incidents, right?

34
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Policy-Maker: Incident reporting is a duty. We'll add a form.

35
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Teacher: If something feels unsafe, I will report to the DSL under KCSIE.

36
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Student: Good. Tell us that in the notice.

37
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Facilitator: Actions: 1) Draft plain‑language notice; 2) Define escalation route; 3) Incident form; 4) DPIA plan.

38
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Innovator: I'll push the Canvas prototype today.

39
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Policy-Maker: I'll draft the escalation RACI and start the DPIA.

40
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Teacher: I'll try the script with my class and gather feedback.

41
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Student: I'll ask my friends what confuses them.

42
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Skeptic: I'll review for cognitive offloading risks.

43
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Facilitator: Before we close—any unresolved blocks?

44
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Policy-Maker: Data governance remains the gap: DPIA and record‑keeping.

45
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Skeptic: Then we should not expand beyond the pilot until that’s complete.

46
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Teacher: Fair.

47
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Innovator: Agreed.

48
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Student: Just keep it human and clear.
